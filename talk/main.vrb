	\item The transformation `adding indirection'. \pause
	\item Realizations of the transformations as functions. \pause
	\item Some arithmetic results in the tiling and low-level transformations. \pause
	\item Work on loops and add loop transformations.\pause
	\item Connect the low-level language with CompCert.
